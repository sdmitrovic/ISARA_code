In Situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (**ISARA**) is an open-source Python codebase that retrieves aerosol particle refractive index and hygroscopicity using user-inputted field campaign instrument data sets. This code relies on Modeled Optical Properties of enSembles of Aerosol Particles (MOPSMAP) package [1].

We hope that the community uses this software to streamline verification of field aerosol data sets and ultimately advance field campaign data quality assurance. More information on this software including installation and use can be found in this "User Guide".
