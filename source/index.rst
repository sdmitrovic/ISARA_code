Welcome to ISARA's documentation!
===================================

In-situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorythm (**ISARA**) is an open-source Python codebase that retrieves aerosol particle refractive index hygroscopicity using user-inputted field campaign instrument data sets. This code relies on  Modeled Optical Properties of ensembles of Aerosol Particles (MOPSMAP) package [1].
 
[1] Gasteiger, J., & Wiegner, M. (2018). MOPSMAP v1.0: a versatile tool for the modeling of aerosol optical properties. Geosci. Model Dev., 11(7), 2739-2762. doi:10.5194/gmd-11-2739-2018

We hope that the community uses this software to streamline verification of field aerosol data sets and ultimately advance field campaign data quality assurance. More information on this software including installation and use can be found in this "User Guide".
